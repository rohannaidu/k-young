--raw data in "home.csv" and "abroad.csv"

--clean_ky_method.ipynb is where I clean the data and set-up a
time-inefficient algorithm that is still executing.

--fast_ky_method.ipynb is where I use the cleaned data and a fast
algorithm to get the results. I test the efficacy of my implementation
on a known example from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemeny%E2%80%93Young_method#Example

--using hrishi's data.ipynb uses data provided by Hrishi and obtains the same
results.

--The result I report is as follows:
A Kemeny-Young aggregation with Kendall-Tau score 7785: Regina,
Joceline, Annette, Meredith, Jay, Isobel, Diamanta, Isaac, Scott, Ross,
Keith, Adam, Aadit, Thaddeus
